# DDD

DDD stands for Domain Driven Design
DDD is an approach to software development that centers around the core domain of your application.

## Why?

1. Improved Collaboration
   DDD encourages (khuyến khích) collaboration between technical team and domian experts, such as bussiness analysts or subject mater experts. By speaking the same "Ubiquitous language", everyone involved can better understand the domain's intricacies, leading to effective communication.

2. Focused Development
   With DDD, you'll identity and focus on the most critical parts of your application - the core domain. This ensures that development efforts are concentrated where they matter most, leading to more valuable software.

3. Better Model
   By using DDD building blocks - Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, and more - you can create a model that closely resembles the realworld problem you're solving. This model often results in more maintainable and adaptable software.

4. Flexibility and Adaptability
   Software built by DDD principles tends to be more flexible and adaptable to changes in the domain. This is vital in today's fast-paced bussiness environments

## Key Concepts

1. Ubiquitous language
   The ubiquitous language is common, shared language that both technical and non-technical team members use to disscuss the domain. It ensures that everyone understands the domain's term and concepts.

2. Bounded Contexts
   Bounded Contexts are explicit boundaries within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable. They help prevent conflicts and misunderstandings when working on large, complex systems.

3. Entities and Value objects
   Entities are objects with distinct identities that are defined by their attributes. Value objects, on other hand, are objects defined by their attributes, but without a distinct identity. They represent concepts like dates, money, geographical coordinates.

4. Aggregates
   Aggregates are groups of related Entities and value objects treated as a single unit. They enforce consistency and transactional boundaries within the domain.
